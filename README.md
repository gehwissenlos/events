How to for the svg file
======

1. Create svg files with Illustrator or other svg application, embed the font as "SVG"
2. Open svg file and change the header and xml line like in header.php, input your php code and save this as a php file 
3. In the font block are the letters and numbers. If you don't need all letters you can remove some to reduce file size and download time
